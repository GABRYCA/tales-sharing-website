# tales-sharing-website
Just an idea, maybe I'll get to work on it this summer, just to share stuff with some friends.

# Good points
Name: TalesAndArts
Domain: talesandarts.anonymousgca.eu OR anonymousgca.eu/talesandarts
Description: A website to share your stories, drawings, etc. with your friends.
Features:
- Share your stories, drawings, etc. with your friends.
- Group arts and stories in "universes" or "series" or "tales".
- Notifications on new arts and stories of followed users, comments, favourites and repost.
- Should be mobile friendly.
- Easy to use, better less functionalities for ease of use.
- Should have a simple backend, not scalable, just for a few users (if the project becomes more ambitious, maybe this will become a concern).
- Storage should be possible through direct links to images too (for example, you got a link to a picture on another art sharing website, you can paste it and will be visible),
This is meant for storage size concerns (I got only 50GB available on my server, and I don't want to pay for more).
- Should use a database, with paths to images stored on the file system or remotely, keeping it simple and universal.
- Should convert images to webp, and store them if uploaded directly and not linked.
- Images should be shown with a width and height of 100% of screen on mobile, on desktop should be a collection of images with a fixed width and height, but no scrollbar (some images will have different aspect ratios).
- Should be possible to register an account with a username, email and password.
- Should have a profile for each user, with a profile picture, a cover picture, a description, a list of followers and a list of following users.
- Should have a search bar, to search for users, universes, series, tales, etc.
- Should have a "feed" page, where you can see the latest arts and stories of the users you follow.
- Should have a "discover" page, where you can see the latest arts and stories of all users.
- Should have a "trending" page, where you can see the most popular arts and stories of all users.
- Should have a "popular" page, where you can see the most popular arts and stories of the users you follow.
- The profile user should be able to edit his profile, change his username, email, password, profile picture, cover picture, description, etc from a settings page.
- The profile should show your arts and stories, stored in universes, series and tales.
- Should have a "create universe" page, where you can create a universe, with a name, description, cover picture, etc.
- Should have a "create series" page, where you can create a series, with a name, description, cover picture, etc.
- Should have a "create tale" page, where you can create a tale, with a name, description, cover picture, etc.
- Should have a "create art" page, where you can upload an art, with a name, description, etc.
- Should have a "create story" page, where you can create a story, with a name, description, cover picture, etc.
- Should be possible to hide your arts to the public and make them private.
- The website should have public global stats, and private stats for each user.
- MAYBE but quite unlikely, an automatic AI filter to detect NSFW content, and hide it from the public.
- Should avoid the usage of cookies (2023 is coming, we don't need cookies anymore).
- Should have an option for each user to easily show or hide AI generated content, not everyone likes that.
